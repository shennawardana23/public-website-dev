### SCRUM @Arch Public Website Dev

SCRUM in Arch Public Website Dev is divided into several main processes

- **_Backlog Refinement_** : This event is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items to ensure that the items at the top of the product backlog are ready for the next sprint.
- **_Sprint Planning_** : During Sprint Planning we answer three important questions:

- Why is this Sprint Valuable?
- What can be done this Sprint?
- How will the chosen work get done?

- **_Sprint_** : The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. The developers are allowed to adjust their plan to achieve the Sprint Goal outside the Daily Scrum as well. Often, they meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions.
- **_Daily Standup_** : The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. The developers are allowed to adjust their plan to achieve the Sprint Goal outside the Daily Scrum as well. Often, they meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions.
- **_Sprint Review_** : Scrum Team Members convey the results of the process during the Sprint in accordance with the Sprint Goal that was agreed upon during the Sprint Planning (Demo Session).
- **_Sprint Retrospect_** : The main purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. It is an opportunity to inspect and adapt the process the Scrum Team has used to build the
increments.
